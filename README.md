🔥 How It Works? (Example Scenario)
1️⃣ Ainur (team lead) publishes a project: "Creating an AI chatbot."

Needs a Frontend, Backend, and ML developer.

The project includes goals, technologies, and a deadline.

2️⃣ Yernar (student, ML engineer) sees the project and applies.
3️⃣ Ainur accepts him into the team.
4️⃣ The team starts development, using the platform for communication and tasks.
5️⃣ After completing the project, Yernar gains experience and a profile record of his work.
💡 This provides real experience that can be added to a resume.

💻 How Is It Implemented? (Technical Part)

API structure:

auth/ → Registration, authentication.

users/ → User profile management.

projects/ → CRUD (create, edit, delete, view projects).

news/ → CRUD for publishing news.

applications/ → Application system for projects.

2. Frontend (ReactJS, Next.js)
